## Branching
- `main` is always deployable
- All changes via Pull Request
- No long-lived branches

## What requires review
- Changes to model logic
- Changes to input data
- Changes to snapshot schema

## What does NOT
- Documentation edits
- Web styling changes

## Rules
- Do not commit notebooks as production code
- Do not change snapshot schema without discussion
- Only GitHub Actions may auto-commit snapshots

## Philosophy
Readable first, clever later.
